    <p> Humans are apes (superfamily Hominoidea).[13] <br />
        The lineage of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus Pongo), then gorillas (genus Gorilla), 
        and finally, chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan). <br />
        The last split, between the human and chimpanzee–bonobo lineages,<br />
         took place around 8–4 million years ago, <br />
         in the late Miocene epoch.[14][15] During this split, <br />
         chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes,<br />
         leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, <br />
         compared to 24 for the other apes.[16]<br />
          Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, <br />
          the hominins diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages – representing the genus Homo and its sole extant species Homo sapiens – are now extinct.[17]
