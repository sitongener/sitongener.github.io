      <a href="../homework1/image/human2.webp">Humans</a> (Homo sapiens) or modern humans are the most common and widespread species of primate, <br />
      and the last surviving species of the genus Homo. 
      <br />
      They are great apes characterized by their <a href="../../sitongener.github.io/homework1/image/human1.jpeg">hairlessness</a>, <br />
      bipedalism, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains,<br /> 
      enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, <br />
      develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:center">Humans are highly social, <br />
      with individual humans tending to belong <br />
      to a multi-layered network of cooperating, <br />
      distinct, or even competing social groups – <br />
      from families and peer groups to corporations
       and political states. </p>
